# Analysis notebooks

This directory contains the notebooks used to perform analysis and to generate figures
and tables in the manuscript. Where possible, these are linked to from the manuscript
itself.

The naming convention of "fig_" refers to notebooks that are primarily for generating
a figure, and similarly, "tab_" notebooks serve to generate a table.

The "analysis_" notebooks are then various bits of analysis used throughout the
manuscript. All values referred to in the manuscript should be derivable from
either these notebooks, or those saved as part of the ``arg_postprocessing``
pipeline.
