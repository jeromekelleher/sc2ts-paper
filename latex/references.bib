abstract={As the {SARS-CoV-2} virus spreads through human populations, the unprecedented accumulation of viral genome sequences is ushering in a new era of `genomic contact tracing'---that is, using viral genomes to trace local transmission dynamics. However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large---and will undoubtedly grow many fold---placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach greatly improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization, making it possible to complete the placements under the constraints of real-time contact tracing. Thus, our method addresses an important need for maintaining a fully updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the University of California Santa Cruz {SARS-CoV-2} Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data. The methods described here will empower research and genomic contact tracing for {SARS-CoV-2} specifically for laboratories worldwide.},

abstract={Phylogenetics has a crucial role in genomic epidemiology. Enabled by unparalleled volumes of genome sequence data generated to study and help contain the COVID-19 pandemic, phylogenetic analyses of {SARS-CoV-2} genomes have shed light on the virus's origins, spread, and the emergence and reproductive success of new variants. However, most phylogenetic approaches, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, cannot scale to the size of the datasets from the current pandemic. We present `MAximum Parsimonious Likelihood Estimation' (MAPLE), an approach for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis of epidemiological genomic datasets at unprecedented scales. MAPLE infers {SARS-CoV-2} phylogenies more accurately than existing maximum likelihood approaches while running up to thousands of times faster, and requiring at least 100 times less memory on large datasets. This extends the reach of genomic epidemiology, allowing the continued use of accurate phylogenetic, phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses on datasets of millions of genomes.},

abstract={As {SARS-CoV-2} continues to spread and evolve, detecting emerging variants early is critical for public health interventions. Inferring lineage prevalence by clinical testing is infeasible at scale, especially in areas with limited resources, participation, or testing and/or sequencing capacity, which can also introduce biases1--3. {SARS-CoV-2} RNA concentration in wastewater successfully tracks regional infection dynamics and provides less biased abundance estimates than clinical testing4,5. Tracking virus genomic sequences in wastewater would improve community prevalence estimates and detect emerging variants. However, two factors limit wastewater-based genomic surveillance: low-quality sequence data and inability to estimate relative lineage abundance in mixed samples. Here we resolve these critical issues to perform a high-resolution, 295-day wastewater and clinical sequencing effort, in the controlled environment of a large university campus and the broader context of the surrounding county. We developed and deployed improved virus concentration protocols and deconvolution software that fully resolve multiple virus strains from wastewater. We detected emerging variants of concern up to 14 days earlier in wastewater samples, and identified multiple instances of virus spread not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our study provides a scalable solution for wastewater genomic surveillance that allows early detection of {SARS-CoV-2} variants and identification of cryptic transmission.},

abstract={Repeated emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS-CoV-2}) variants with increased fitness underscores the value of rapid detection and characterization of new lineages. We have developed PyR0, a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that infers relative prevalence of all viral lineages across geographic regions, detects lineages increasing in prevalence, and identifies mutations relevant to fitness. Applying PyR0 to all publicly available {SARS-CoV-2} genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase fitness, including previously identified spike mutations and many nonspike mutations within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. PyR0 forecasts growth of new lineages from their mutational profile, ranks the fitness of lineages as new sequences become available, and prioritizes mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS-CoV-2}) pandemic has been characterized by waves of transmission initiated by new variants replacing older ones. Given this pattern of emergence, there is an obvious need for the early detection of novel variants to prevent excess deaths. Obermeyer et al. have developed a Bayesian model to compare relative transmissibility of all viral lineages. Using this model, emerging lineages can be spotted together with the mutations that contribute toward transmissibility, not only in Spike, but also in other viral proteins. The model can prioritize lineages as they emerge for public health concern. ?CA A Bayesian hierarchical model of all {SARS-CoV-2} viral genomes predicts lineage transmissibility and identifies associated mutations.},

abstract={Accurate and timely detection of recombinant lineages is crucial for interpreting genetic variation, reconstructing epidemic spread, identifying selection and variants of interest, and accurately performing phylogenetic analyses1--4. During the {SARS-CoV-2} pandemic, genomic data generation has exceeded the capacities of existing analysis platforms, thereby crippling real-time analysis of viral evolution5. Here, we use a new phylogenomic method to search a nearly comprehensive {SARS-CoV-2} phylogeny for recombinant lineages. In a 1.6 million sample tree from May 2021, we identify 589 recombination events, which indicate that around 2.7{\%} of sequenced {SARS-CoV-2} genomes have detectable recombinant ancestry. Recombination breakpoints are inferred to occur disproportionately in the 3' portion of the genome that contains the spike protein. Our results highlight the need for timely analyses of recombination for pinpointing the emergence of recombinant lineages with the potential to increase transmissibility or virulence of the virus. We anticipate that this approach will empower comprehensive real-time tracking of viral recombination during the {SARS-CoV-2} pandemic and beyond.},

Since February 2021, the Pango dynamic lineage nomenclature for {SARS-CoV-2} has been sustained by crowdsourced lineage proposals as new isolates were sequenced. This approach is vulnerable to time-critical delays as well as regional and personal bias. Here we developed a simple heuristic approach for dividing phylogenetic trees into lineages, including the prioritization of key mutations or genes. Our implementation is efficient on extremely large phylogenetic trees consisting of millions of sequences and produces similar results to existing manually curated lineage designations when applied to {SARS-CoV-2} and other viruses including chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus complex and Zika virus. This method offers a simple, automated and consistent approach to pathogen nomenclature that can assist researchers in developing and maintaining phylogeny-based classifications in the face of ever-increasing genomic datasets.},

abstract={Summary We present evidence for multiple independent origins of recombinant {SARS-CoV-2} viruses sampled from late 2020 and early 2021 in the United Kingdom. Their genomes carry single-nucleotide polymorphisms and deletions that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern but lack the full complement of lineage-defining mutations. Instead, the remainder of their genomes share contiguous genetic variation with non-B.1.1.7 viruses circulating in the same geographic area at the same time as the recombinants. In four instances, there was evidence for onward transmission of a recombinant-origin virus, including one transmission cluster of 45 sequenced cases over the course of 2 months. The inferred genomic locations of recombination breakpoints suggest that every community-transmitted recombinant virus inherited its spike region from a B.1.1.7 parental virus, consistent with a transmission advantage for B.1.1.7's set of mutations.},

abstract={Viral recombination can generate novel genotypes with unique phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility and virulence. Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, recombination between strains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ({SARS-CoV-2}) has not been characterized in detail. Here, we present a lightweight approach for detecting genomes that are potentially recombinant. This approach relies on identifying the mutations that primarily determine {SARS-CoV-2} clade structure and then screening genomes for ones that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried that were deposited on GISAID.org prior to 16 February 2021, we detected 1,175 potential recombinant sequences. Using a highly conservative criteria to exclude sequences that may have originated through de novo mutation, we find that at least 30{\thinspace}per cent (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}358) are likely of recombinant origin. An analysis of deep-sequencing data for these putative recombinants, where available, indicated that the majority are high quality. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in this subset of potential recombinants. An analysis of these genomes did not reveal evidence for recombination hotspots in the {SARS-CoV-2} genome. While most of the putative recombinant sequences we detected were genetic singletons, a small number of genetically identical or highly similar recombinant sequences were identified in the same geographic region, indicative of locally circulating lineages. Recombinant genomes were also found to have originated from parental lineages with substitutions of concern, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 0.2--2.5{\thinspace}per cent of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant. Our identification of a small number of putative recombinants within the first year of {SARS-CoV-2} circulation underscores the need to sustain efforts to monitor the emergence of new genotypes generated through recombination.},

abstract={The evolutionary process of genetic recombination has the potential to rapidly change the properties of a viral pathogen, and its presence is a crucial factor to consider in the development of treatments and vaccines. It can also significantly affect the results of phylogenetic analyses and the inference of evolutionary rates. The detection of recombination from samples of sequencing data is a very challenging problem and is further complicated for {SARS-CoV-2} by its relatively slow accumulation of genetic diversity. The extent to which recombination is ongoing for {SARS-CoV-2} is not yet resolved. To address this, we use a parsimony-based method to reconstruct possible genealogical histories for samples of {SARS-CoV-2} sequences, which enables us to pinpoint specific recombination events that could have generated the data. We propose a statistical framework for disentangling the effects of recurrent mutation from recombination in the history of a sample, and hence provide a way of estimating the probability that ongoing recombination is present. We apply this to samples of sequencing data collected in England and South Africa and find evidence of ongoing recombination.},

abstract={In late 2022, {SARS-CoV-2} Omicron subvariants have become highly diversified, and XBB is spreading rapidly around the world. Our phylogenetic analyses suggested that XBB emerged through the recombination of two cocirculating BA.2 lineages, BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 (a progeny of BA.2.75), during the summer of 2022. XBB.1 is the variant most profoundly resistant to BA.2/5 breakthrough infection sera to date and is more fusogenic than BA.2.75. The recombination breakpoint is located in the receptor-binding domain of spike, and each region of the recombinant spike confers immune evasion and increases fusogenicity. We further provide the structural basis for the interaction between XBB.1 spike and human ACE2. Finally, the intrinsic pathogenicity of XBB.1 in male hamsters is comparable to or even lower than that of BA.2.75. Our multiscale investigation provides evidence suggesting that XBB is the first observed {SARS-CoV-2} variant to increase its fitness through recombination rather than substitutions.},

abstract={As a result of recombination, adjacent nucleotides can have different paths of genetic inheritance and therefore the genealogical trees for a sample of DNA sequences vary along the genome. The structure capturing the details of these intricately interwoven paths of inheritance is referred to as an ancestral recombination graph (ARG). Classical formalisms have focused on mapping coalescence and recombination events to the nodes in an ARG. However, this approach is out of step with some modern developments, which do not represent genetic inheritance in terms of these events or explicitly infer them. We present a simple formalism that defines an ARG in terms of specific genomes and their intervals of genetic inheritance, and show how it generalizes these classical treatments and encompasses the outputs of recent methods. We discuss nuances arising from this more general structure, and argue that it forms an appropriate basis for a software standard in this rapidly growing field.},

Here we introduce an algorithm that is able to not only infer whole-genome histories with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but also process four orders of magnitude more sequences. The approach also provides an `evolutionary encoding' of the data, enabling efficient calculation of relevant statistics.

abstract={Knowledge of genome-wide genealogies for thousands of individuals would simplify most evolutionary analyses for humans and other species, but has remained computationally infeasible. We have developed a method, Relate, scaling to{\thinspace}>10,000 sequences while simultaneously estimating branch lengths, mutational ages and variable historical population sizes, as well as allowing for data errors. Application to 1,000 Genomes Project haplotypes produces joint genealogical histories for 26 human populations. Highly diverged lineages are present in all groups, but most frequent in Africa. Outside Africa, these mainly reflect ancient introgression from groups related to Neanderthals and Denisovans, while African signals instead reflect unknown events unique to that continent. Our approach allows more powerful inferences of natural selection than has previously been possible. We identify multiple regions under strong positive selection, and multi-allelic traits including hair color, body mass index and blood pressure, showing strong evidence of directional selection, varying among human groups.},

We introduce a method, ARG-Needle, for accurately inferring biobank-scale genealogies from sequencing or genotyping array data, as well as strategies to utilize genealogies to perform association and other complex trait analyses. We use these methods to build genome-wide genealogies using genotyping data for 337,464 UK Biobank individuals and test for association across seven complex traits. Genealogy-based association detects more rare and ultra-rare signals (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}134, frequency range 0.0007−0.1{\%}) than genotype imputation using {\textasciitilde}65,000 sequenced haplotypes (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}64).

These results demonstrate that inferred genome-wide genealogies may be leveraged in the analysis of complex traits, complementing approaches that require the availability of large, population-specific sequencing panels.},

abstract={The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is a structure that represents the history of coalescent and recombination events connecting a set of sequences (Hudson RR. In: Futuyma D, Antonovics J, editors. Gene genealogies and the coalescent process. In: Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology; 1991. p. 1 to 44.). The full ARG can be represented as a set of genealogical trees at every locus in the genome, annotated with recombination events that change the topology of the trees between adjacent loci and the mutations that occurred along the branches of those trees (Griffiths RC, Marjoram P. An ancestral recombination graph. In: Donnelly P, Tavare S, editors. Progress in population genetics and human evolution. Springer; 1997. p. 257 to 270.). Valuable insights can be gained into past evolutionary processes, such as demographic events or the influence of natural selection, by studying the ARG. It is regarded as the ``holy grail'' of population genetics (Hubisz M, Siepel A. Inference of ancestral recombination graphs using ARGweaver. In: Dutheil JY, editors. Statistical population genomics. New York, NY: Springer US; 2020. p. 231--266.) since it encodes the processes that generate all patterns of allelic and haplotypic variation from which all commonly used summary statistics in population genetic research (e.g. heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium) can be derived. Many previous evolutionary inferences relied on summary statistics extracted from the genotype matrix. Evolutionary inferences using the ARG represent a significant advancement as the ARG is a representation of the evolutionary history of a sample that shows the past history of recombination, coalescence, and mutation events across a particular sequence. This representation in theory contains as much information, if not more, than the combination of all independent summary statistics that could be derived from the genotype matrix. Consistent with this idea, some of the first ARG-based analyses have proven to be more powerful than summary statistic-based analyses (Speidel L, Forest M, Shi S, Myers SR. A method for genome-wide genealogy estimation for thousands of samples. Nat Genet. 2019:51(9):1321 to 1329.; Stern AJ, Wilton PR, Nielsen R.

As such, there has been significant interest in the field to investigate 2 main problems related to the ARG: (i) How can we estimate the ARG based on genomic data, and (ii) how can we extract information of past evolutionary processes from the ARG? In this perspective, we highlight 3 topics that pertain to these main issues: The development of computational innovations that enable the estimation of the ARG; remaining challenges in estimating the ARG; and methodological advances for deducing evolutionary forces and mechanisms using the ARG. This perspective serves to introduce the readers to the types of questions that can be explored using the ARG and to highlight some of the most pressing issues that must be addressed in order to make ARG-based inference an indispensable tool for evolutionary research.},

abstract={In the presence of recombination, the evolutionary relationships between a set of sampled genomes cannot be described by a single genealogical tree. Instead, the genomes are related by a complex, interwoven collection of genealogies formalized in a structure called an ancestral recombination graph (ARG). An ARG extensively encodes the ancestry of the genome(s) and thus is replete with valuable information for addressing diverse questions in evolutionary biology. Despite its potential utility, technological and methodological limitations, along with a lack of approachable literature, have severely restricted awareness and application of ARGs in evolution research. Excitingly, recent progress in ARG reconstruction and simulation have made ARG-based approaches feasible for many questions and systems. In this review, we provide an accessible introduction and exploration of ARGs, survey recent methodological breakthroughs, and describe the potential for ARGs to further existing goals and open avenues of inquiry that were previously inaccessible in evolutionary genomics. Through this discussion, we aim to more widely disseminate the promise of ARGs in evolutionary genomics and encourage the broader development and adoption of ARG-based inference.},

abstract={Author Summary The unusual and complex correlation structure of population samples of genetic sequences presents a fundamental statistical challenge that pervades nearly all areas of population genetics. Historical recombination events produce an intricate network of intertwined genealogies, which impedes demography inference, the detection of natural selection, association mapping, and other applications. It is possible to capture these complex relationships using a representation called the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which provides a complete description of coalescence and recombination events in the history of the sample. However, previous methods for ARG inference have not been adequately fast and accurate for practical use with large-scale genomic sequence data. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that has vastly improved scaling properties. Our algorithm is implemented in a computer program called ARGweaver, which is fast enough to be applied to sequences megabases in length. With the aid of a large computer cluster, ARGweaver can be used to sample full ARGs for entire mammalian genome sequences. We show that ARGweaver performs well in simulation experiments and demonstrate that it can be used to provide new insights about both demographic processes and natural selection when applied to real human genome sequence data.},

abstract={The {SARS-CoV-2} genome occupies a unique place in infection biology -- it is the most highly sequenced genome on earth (making up over 20{\%} of public sequencing datasets) with fine scale information on sampling date and geography, and has been subject to unprecedented intense analysis. As a result, these phylogenetic data are an incredibly valuable resource for science and public health. However, the vast majority of the data was sequenced by tiling amplicons across the full genome, with amplicon schemes that changed over the pandemic as mutations in the viral genome interacted with primer binding sites. In combination with the disparate set of genome assembly workflows and lack of consistent quality control (QC) processes, the current genomes have many systematic errors that have evolved with the virus and amplicon schemes. These errors have significant impacts on the phylogeny, and therefore over the last few years, many thousands of hours of researchers time has been spent in ``eyeballing'' trees, looking for artefacts, and then patching the tree.Given the huge value of this dataset, we therefore set out to reprocess the complete set of public raw sequence data in a rigorous amplicon-aware manner, and build a cleaner phylogeny. Here we provide a global tree of 4,471,579 samples, built from a consistently assembled set of high quality consensus sequences from all available public data as of June 2024, viewable at https://viridian.taxonium.org. Each genome was constructed using a novel assembly tool called Viridian (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/viridian), developed specifically to process amplicon sequence data, eliminating artefactual errors and mask the genome at low quality positions. We provide simulation and empirical validation of the methodology, and quantify the improvement in the phylogeny. We hope the tree, consensus sequences and Viridian will be a valuable resource for researchers.Competing Interest StatementGavin Screaton sits on the GSK Vaccines Scientific Advisory Board, consults for AstraZeneca, and is a founding member of RQ Biotechnology.},

The rate of genome generation is unprecedented, yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of {SARS-CoV-2}. Here, we present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and delabelling virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are probably inactive. By focusing on active virus lineages and those spreading to new locations, this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and determinants of the global spread of {SARS-CoV-2}.},

abstract={We introduce a new statistical model for patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among multiple SNPs in a population sample. The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a ``block-like'' structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},

abstract={Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS-CoV-2}) has caused millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Intense scientific effort to understand the biology of {SARS-CoV-2} has resulted in daunting numbers of genomic sequences. We witnessed evolutionary events that could mostly be inferred indirectly before, such as the emergence of variants with distinct phenotypes, for example transmissibility, severity and immune evasion. This Review explores the mechanisms that generate genetic variation in {SARS-CoV-2}, underlying the within-host and population-level processes that underpin these events. We examine the selective forces that likely drove the evolution of higher transmissibility and, in some cases, higher severity during the first year of the pandemic and the role of antigenic evolution during the second and third years, together with the implications of immune escape and reinfections, and the increasing evidence for and potential relevance of recombination. In order to understand how major lineages, such as variants of concern (VOCs), are generated, we contrast the evidence for the chronic infection model underlying the emergence of VOCs with the possibility of an animal reservoir playing a role in {SARS-CoV-2} evolution, and conclude that the former is more likely. We evaluate uncertainties and outline scenarios for the possible future evolutionary trajectories of {SARS-CoV-2}.},

Thus, an urgent need arises to establish a comprehensive landscape concerning {SARS-CoV-2} recombinants worldwide and elucidate their evolutionary mechanisms. However, the initial step, involving the detection of potential recombinants from a vast pool of over 10 million sequences, presents a significant obstacle. In this study, we present CovRecomb, a lightweight methodology specifically designed to effectively identify and dissect interlineage {SARS-CoV-2} recombinants. Leveraging CovRecomb, we successfully detected 135,567 putative recombinants across the entirety of 14.5 million accessed {SARS-CoV-2} genomes. These putative recombinants could be classified into 1451 distinct recombination events, of which 206 demonstrated transmission spanning multiple countries, continents, or globally. Hotspot regions were identified in six specific areas, with prominence observed in the latter halves of the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain within the spike (S) gene. Epidemiological investigations revealed extensive recombination events occurring among different {SARS-CoV-2} (sub)lineages, independent of lineage prevalence frequencies.},

abstract={Due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately determining the true global infection count has become an extremely challenging task. In this context, our study explores the spatial spillover analysis of COVID-19 cases and assesses the impact of containment policy stringency on these spillovers. Furthermore, we examine the extent of under-reporting of COVID-19 cases at the country level. To account for diverse spatial dependencies, we employ a semiparametric spatial autoregressive model, in which the coefficients are smooth, unknown functions of countries' stringency indices. Country-specific under-reporting, modeled as a one-sided deterministic function of exogenous variables, is estimated using the sieves method. Our analysis relies on COVID-19 infection data from 57 countries, which span from 2020 to 2021. We find that spillovers vary significantly across different levels of containment stringency. In addition, the true number of infections is estimated to be 1.72 to 5.73 times higher than the reported cases. These results align with previous research and have important policy implications for improving the precision of COVID-19 reporting and managing spillover effects more effectively.},

abstract={Genetic recombination is a major evolutionary mechanism among RNA viruses, and it is common in coronaviruses, including those infecting humans. A few {SARS-CoV-2} recombinants have been reported to date whose genome harbored combinations of mutations from different mutants or variants, but only a single patient's sample was analyzed, and the virus was not isolated. Here, we report the gradual emergence of a hybrid genome of B.1.160 and Alpha variants in a lymphoma patient chronically infected for 14 months, and we isolated the recombinant virus. The hybrid genome was obtained by next-generation sequencing, and the recombination sites were confirmed by PCR. This consisted of a parental B.1.160 backbone interspersed with two fragments, including the spike gene, from an Alpha variant. An analysis of seven sequential samples from the patient decoded the recombination steps, including the initial infection with a B.1.160 variant, then a concurrent infection with this variant and an Alpha variant, the generation of hybrid genomes, and eventually the emergence of a predominant recombinant virus isolated at the end of the patient's follow-up. This case exemplifies the recombination process of {SARS-CoV-2} in real life, and it calls for intensifying the genomic surveillance in patients coinfected with different {SARS-CoV-2} variants, and more generally with several RNA viruses, as this may lead to the appearance of new viruses.},

abstract={As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a summary function; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected value of the dual site statistic under the infinite sites model of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to implement many currently defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics' relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

abstract={Variant Call Format (VCF) is the standard file format for interchanging genetic variation data and associated quality control metrics. The usual row-wise encoding of the VCF data model (either as text or packed binary) emphasizes efficient retrieval of all data for a given variant, but accessing data on a field or sample basis is inefficient. The Biobank-scale datasets currently available consist of hundreds of thousands of whole genomes and hundreds of terabytes of compressed VCF. Row-wise data storage is fundamentally unsuitable and a more scalable approach is needed.Zarr is a format for storing multidimensional data that is widely used across the sciences, and is ideally suited to massively parallel processing. We present the VCF Zarr specification, an encoding of the VCF data model using Zarr, along with fundamental software infrastructure for efficient and reliable conversion at scale. We show how this format is far more efficient than standard VCF-based approaches, and competitive with specialized methods for storing genotype data in terms of compression ratios and single-threaded calculation performance. We present case studies on subsets of 3 large human datasets (Genomics England: {\$}n{\$}=78,195; Our Future Health: {\$}n{\$}=651,050; All of Us: {\$}n{\$}=245,394) along with whole genome datasets for Norway Spruce ({\$}n{\$}=1,063) and {SARS-CoV-2} ({\$}n{\$}=4,484,157). We demonstrate the potential for VCF Zarr to enable a new generation of high-performance and cost-effective applications via illustrative examples using cloud computing and GPUs.Large row-encoded VCF files are a major bottleneck for current research, and storing and processing these files incurs a substantial cost. The VCF Zarr specification, building on widely used, open-source technologies, has the potential to greatly reduce these costs, and may enable a diverse ecosystem of next-generation tools for analysing genetic variation data directly from cloud-based object stores, while maintaining compatibility with existing file-oriented workflows.},

The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method.

A key strength of such coalescent models is that they enable efficient simulation of data we might see under a variety of evolutionary scenarios. However, current methods are not well suited to simulating genome-scale data sets on hundreds of thousands of samples, which is essential if we are to understand the data generated by population-scale sequencing projects. Similarly, processing the results of large simulations also presents researchers with a major challenge, as it can take many days just to read the data files. In this paper we solve these problems by introducing a new way to represent information about the ancestral process. This new representation leads to huge gains in simulation speed and storage efficiency so that large simulations complete in minutes and the output files can be processed in seconds.},

abstract={With the desire to model population genetic processes under increasingly realistic scenarios, forward genetic simulations have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright--Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright--Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright--Fisher or ``nonWF'' model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use.},

abstract={The sequencing of modern and ancient genomes from around the world has revolutionized our understanding of human history and evolution. However, the problem of how best to characterize ancestral relationships from the totality of human genomic variation remains unsolved. Here, we address this challenge with nonparametric methods that enable us to infer a unified genealogy of modern and ancient humans. This compact representation of multiple datasets explores the challenges of missing and erroneous data and uses ancient samples to constrain and date relationships. We demonstrate the power of the method to recover relationships between individuals and populations as well as to identify descendants of ancient samples. Finally, we introduce a simple nonparametric estimator of the geographical location of ancestors that recapitulates key events in human history. Hundreds of thousands of modern human genomes and thousands of ancient human genomes have been generated to date. However, different methods and data quality can make comparisons among them difficult. Furthermore, every human genome contains segments from ancestries of varying ages. Wohns et al. applied a tree recording method to ancient and modern human genomes to generate a unified human genealogy (see the Perspective by Rees and Andr{\'e}s). This method allows for missing and erroneous data and uses ancient genomes to calibrate genomic coalescent times. This permits us to determine how our genomes have changed over time and between populations, informing upon the evolution of our species. ?LMZ A genealogy of modern and ancient genomes provides insight into human history and evolution.},

The flexibility of forward-time simulation makes it especially valuable for these efforts, allowing for the simulation of arbitrarily complex scenarios in a way that mimics how real populations evolve. Here, we present Geonomics, a Python package for performing complex, spatially explicit, landscape genomic simulations with full spatial pedigrees that dramatically reduces user workload yet remains customizable and extensible because it is embedded within a popular, general-purpose language. We show that Geonomics results are consistent with expectations for a variety of validation tests based on classic models in population genetics and then demonstrate its utility and flexibility with a trio of more complex simulation scenarios that feature polygenic selection, selection on multiple traits, simulation on complex landscapes, and nonstationary environmental change. We then discuss runtime, which is primarily sensitive to landscape raster size, memory usage, which is primarily sensitive to maximum population size and recombination rate, and other caveats related to the model's methods for approximating recombination and movement. Taken together, our tests and demonstrations show that Geonomics provides an efficient and robust platform for population genomic simulations that capture complex spatial and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract={Population genetics is transitioning into a data-driven discipline thanks to the availability of large-scale genomic data and the need to study increasingly complex evolutionary scenarios. With likelihood and Bayesian approaches becoming either intractable or computationally unfeasible, machine learning, and in particular deep learning, algorithms are emerging as popular techniques for population genetic inferences. These approaches rely on algorithms that learn non-linear relationships between the input data and the model parameters being estimated through representation learning from training data sets. Deep learning algorithms currently employed in the field comprise discriminative and generative models with fully connected, convolutional, or recurrent layers. Additionally, a wide range of powerful simulators to generate training data under complex scenarios are now available. The application of deep learning to empirical data sets mostly replicates previous findings of demography reconstruction and signals of natural selection in model organisms. To showcase the feasibility of deep learning to tackle new challenges, we designed a branched architecture to detect signals of recent balancing selection from temporal haplotypic data, which exhibited good predictive performance on simulated data. Investigations on the interpretability of neural networks, their robustness to uncertain training data, and creative representation of population genetic data, will provide further opportunities for technological advancements in the field.},

Aspects of this history can inform us about evolutionary processes, ages of mutations and times of common ancestors, and historical population sizes and migration rates. Performing such inferences is difficult, and progress has been slow over the past two decades. Recently, a new and more efficient way to store sequence data has led to improved simulations and also a fast way to reconstruct some aspects of the history. We augment the new data structure to infer many more details of the history, including the times of events. We also provide approximations of the full probability distributions for all the unknowns, not just plausible values. Because this task is highly challenging, we are limited to relatively small data sets, but we show that our inference algorithm represents an important step forward over those currently available in terms of the accuracy of its inferences.},

abstract={In the presence of recombination individuals may inherit different regions of their genome from different ancestors, resulting in a mosaic of phylogenetic histories across their genome. Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) can capture how phylogenetic relationships vary across the genome due to recombination, but reconstructing ARGs from genomic sequence data is notoriously difficult. Here, we present a method for reconciling discordant phylogenetic trees and reconstructing ARGs using maximum agreement forests (MAFs). Given two discordant trees, a MAF identifies the smallest possible set of topologically concordant subtrees present in both trees. We show how discordant trees can be reconciled through their MAF in a way that retains discordances strongly supported by sequence data while eliminating conflicts likely attributable to phylogenetic noise. We further show how MAFs and our reconciliation approach can be combined to select a path of local trees across the genome that maximizes the likelihood of the genomic sequence data, minimizes discordance between neighboring local trees, and identifies the recombination events necessary to explain remaining discordances to obtain a fully connected ARG. While heuristic, our ARG reconstruction approach is often as accurate as more exact methods while being much more computationally efficient. Moreover, important demographic parameters such as recombination rates can be accurately estimated from reconstructed ARGs. Finally, we apply our approach to plant infecting RNA viruses in the genus Potyvirus to demonstrate how true recombination events can be disentangled from phylogenetic noise using our ARG reconstruction methods.},

abstract={Motivation: In systematic biology, one is often faced with the task of comparing different phylogenetic trees, in particular in multi-gene analysis or cospeciation studies. One approach is to use a tanglegram in which two rooted phylogenetic trees are drawn opposite each other, using auxiliary lines to connect matching taxa. There is an increasing interest in using rooted phylogenetic networks to represent evolutionary history, so as to explicitly represent reticulate events, such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization or reassortment. Thus, the question arises how to define and compute a tanglegram for such networks.Results: In this article, we present the first formal definition of a tanglegram for rooted phylogenetic networks and present a heuristic approach for computing one, called the NN-tanglegram method. We compare the performance of our method with existing tree tanglegram algorithms and also show a typical application to real biological datasets. For maximum usability, the algorithm does not require that the trees or networks are bifurcating or bicombining, or that they are on identical taxon sets.Availability: The algorithm is implemented in our program Dendroscope 3, which is freely available from www.dendroscope.org.Contact:  scornava@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de; huson@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de},

abstract={Recombination is an ongoing and increasingly important feature of circulating lineages of {SARS-CoV-2}, challenging how we represent the evolutionary history of this virus and giving rise to new variants of potential public health concern by combining transmission and immune evasion properties of different lineages. Detection of new recombinant strains is challenging, with most methods looking for breaks between sets of mutations that characterise distinct lineages. In addition, many basic approaches fundamental to the study of viral evolution assume that recombination is negligible, in that a single phylogenetic tree can represent the genetic ancestry of the circulating strains. Here we present an initial version of sc2ts, a method to automatically detect recombinants in real time and to cohesively integrate them into a genealogy in the form of an ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which jointly records mutation, recombination and genetic inheritance. We infer two ARGs under different sampling strategies, and study their properties. One contains 1.27 million sequences sampled up to June 30, 2021, and the second is more sparsely sampled, consisting of 657K sequences sampled up to June 30, 2022. We find that both ARGs are highly consistent with known features of {SARS-CoV-2} evolution, recovering the basic backbone phylogeny, mutational spectra, and recapitulating details on the majority of known recombinant lineages. Using the well-established and feature-rich tskit library, the ARGs can also be stored concisely and processed efficiently using standard Python tools. For example, the ARG for 1.27 million sequences---encoding the inferred reticulate ancestry, genetic variation, and extensive metadata---requires 58MB of storage, and loads in less than a second. The ability to fully integrate the effects of recombination into downstream analyses, to quickly and automatically detect new recombinants, and to utilise an efficient and convenient platform for computation based on well-engineered technologies makes sc2ts a promising approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, by processing millions of publicly shared genomes, we show that certain MNMs are highly recurrent in {SARS-CoV-2}: they repeatedly and consistently modify the same multiple nucleotides at the same genome position in the same way. The most frequent of these MNMs have independently occurred hundreds of times across all {SARS-CoV-2} lineages.The vast majority of these recurrent MNMs are linked to transcription regulatory sequences. We propose a mechanism that explains them through template switching as part of the natural transcription process of the virus.This previously unknown mutational pattern increases our understanding of the evolution of {SARS-CoV-2} and potentially many other nidoviruses. It also has important consequences for computational evolutionary biology: we show that for example recurrent MNMs cause approximately 14{\%} of false positives during inference of recombination in {SARS-CoV-2}.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract={Public {SARS-CoV-2} genomes from the Delta lineage show complex and confusing patterns of mutations at Spike codon 142, and at another nearby position, Spike codon 95. It has been hypothesised that these represent recurrent mutations with interesting evolutionary dynamics, and that these mutations may affect viral load. Here we show that these patterns, and the relationship with viral load, are artifacts of sequencing difficulties in this region of the Delta genome caused be a deletion in the binding site for the 72_RIGHT primer of the ARTIC V3 schema. Spike G142D should be considered a lineage-defining mutation of Delta.},

abstract={Snipit is an analysis and visualization tool designed for summarizing single nucleotide polymorphisms in sequences in comparison to a reference sequence. This tool efficiently catalogues nucleotide and amino acid differences, enabling clear comparisons through customizable, publication-ready figures. With features such as configurable colour palettes, customizable record sorting, and the ability to output figures in multiple formats, snipit offers a user-friendly interface for researchers across diverse disciplines. In addition, snipit includes a specialized recombi-mode for illustrating recombination patterns, which can highlight otherwise often difficult-to-detect relationships between sequences.Snipit is an open-source python-based tool that is hosted on GitHub under a GNU-GPL 3.0 licence (https://github.com/aineniamh/snipit). It can be installed from PyPi using pip. Source code and additional documentation can be found on the GitHub repository.},

abstract={Although most mutations in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome are expected to be either deleterious and swiftly purged or relatively neutral, a small proportion will affect functional properties and may alter infectivity, disease severity or interactions with host immunity. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 was followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations, in the context of `variants of concern', that impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS-CoV-2 variants by postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of correlates of protection is required to evaluate how this may impact vaccine effectiveness. Nonetheless, manufacturers are preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and antigenic changes in the global virus population is done alongside experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of mutations. In this Review, we summarize the literature on mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the primary antigen, focusing on their impacts on antigenicity and contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss them in the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets.},

journal={BMC Ecology and Evolution},
year={2022},
month={Oct},
day={28},
volume={22},
number={1},
pages={123},
abstract={The genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains many insertions/deletions (indels) from the genomes of other SARS-related coronaviruses. Some of the identified indels have recently reported to involve relatively long segments of 10--300 consecutive bases and with diverse RNA sequences around gaps between virus species, both of which are different characteristics from the classical shorter in-frame indels. These non-classical complex indels have been identified in non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3), the S1 domain of the spike (S), and open reading frame 8 (ORF8). To determine whether the occurrence of these non-classical indels in specific genomic regions is ubiquitous among broad species of SARS-related coronaviruses in different animal hosts, the present study compared SARS-related coronaviruses from humans (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), bats (RaTG13 and Rc-o319), and pangolins (GX-P4L), by performing multiple sequence alignment. As a result, indel hotspots with diverse RNA sequences of different lengths between the viruses were confirmed in the Nsp2 gene (approximately 2500--2600 base positions in the overall 29,900 bases), Nsp3 gene (approximately 3000--3300 and 3800--3900 base positions), N-terminal domain of the spike protein (21,500--22,500 base positions), and ORF8 gene (27,800--28,200 base positions). Abnormally high rate of point mutations and complex indels in these regions suggest that the occurrence of mutations in these hotspots may be selectively neutral or even benefit the survival of the viruses. The presence of such indel hotspots has not been reported in different human SARS-CoV-2 strains in the last 2 years, suggesting a lower rate of indels in human SARS-CoV-2. Future studies to elucidate the mechanisms enabling the frequent development of long and complex indels in specific genomic regions of SARS-related coronaviruses would offer deeper insights into the process of viral evolution.},

abstract={Since November 2021, five genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineages (BA.1--BA.5) are believed to have emerged in southern Africa, with four (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5) spreading globally and collectively dominating SARS-CoV-2 diversity. In 2023, BA.2.86, a highly divergent BA.2 lineage that rose to prominence worldwide, was first detected in Israel and Denmark, but the subsequent diversity of South African sequences suggests it too emerged in the region. Using Bayesian phylogeographic inference, we reconstruct the origins and dispersal patterns of BA.1--BA.5 and BA.2.86. Our findings suggest that Gauteng province in South Africa likely played a key role in the emergence and/or amplification of multiple Omicron lineages, though regions with limited sampling may have also contributed. The challenge of precisely tracing these origins highlights the need for broader genomic surveillance across the region to strengthen early detection, track viral evolution, and improve preparedness for future threats.},

abstract={The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak marks the first time that large amounts of genome sequence data have been generated and made publicly available in near real time. Early analyses of these data revealed low sequence variation, a finding that is consistent with a recently emerging outbreak, but which raises the question of whether such data are sufficiently informative for phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary rates and time scales. The phylodynamic threshold is a key concept that refers to the point in time at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in available genome samples to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates. For example, before the phylodynamic threshold is reached, genomic variation is so low that even large amounts of genome sequences may be insufficient to estimate the virus's evolutionary rate and the time scale of an outbreak. We collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases at eight different points in time and conducted a range of tests of temporal signal to determine if and when the phylodynamic threshold was reached, and the range of inferences that could be reliably drawn from these data. Our results indicate that by 2 February 2020, estimates of evolutionary rates and time scales had become possible. Analyses of subsequent data sets, that included between 47 and 122 genomes, converged at an evolutionary rate of about 1.1{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−3 subs/site/year and a time of origin of around late November 2019. Our study provides guidelines to assess the phylodynamic threshold and demonstrates that establishing this threshold constitutes a fundamental step for understanding the power and limitations of early data in outbreak genome surveillance.},

abstract={High-throughput sequencing enables rapid genome sequencing during infectious disease outbreaks and provides an opportunity to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in near real-time. One difficulty of undertaking evolutionary analyses over short timescales is the dependency of the inferred evolutionary parameters on the timespan of observation. Crucially, there are an increasing number of molecular clock analyses using external evolutionary rate priors to infer evolutionary parameters. However, it is not clear which rate prior is appropriate for a given time window of observation due to the time-dependent nature of evolutionary rate estimates. Here, we characterize the molecular evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza during the first 12 months of their respective pandemics. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate the dates of emergence, evolutionary rates, and growth rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 over time and investigate how varying sampling window and data set sizes affect the accuracy of parameter estimation. We further use a generalized McDonald--Kreitman test to estimate the number of segregating nonneutral sites over time. We find that the inferred evolutionary parameters for both pandemics are time dependent, and that the inferred rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 decline by ∼50{\%} and ∼100{\%}, respectively, over the course of 1 year. After at least 4 months since the start of sequence sampling, inferred growth rates and emergence dates remain relatively stable and can be inferred reliably using a logistic growth coalescent model. We show that the time dependency of the mean substitution rate is due to elevated substitution rates at terminal branches which are 2--4 times higher than those of internal branches for both viruses. The elevated rate at terminal branches is strongly correlated with an increasing number of segregating nonneutral sites, demonstrating the role of purifying selection in generating the time dependency of evolutionary parameters during pandemics.},
